Starting from Reddit Comments regarding SP500 firms, we scraped them, we assign them a polarity score with both bag of words methods (Textblob and Vader) abd ML algorithm (BERT), we implemented strategies with weekly and daily frequency. To achieve the realization of a zero cost portfolio , we organized the stocks in deciles accorting to the sentiment score. We then went short with the stocks in the lowest deciles and long with the stocks placed in the first deciles. Even if the return we got is positive, the high trading costs make us us doubt about the goodness of the startegy. This behaviour seems to confirm market efficiency.
